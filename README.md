# Landing-page-of-fictional-product-using-html-and-css
This is a clean landing page for a bicycle product using just HTML and CSS.
It features a bold background, a smooth nav bar with links and buttons, and a glowing animated tagline in the center.
HTML builds the layout with simple divs, lists, and headings.
CSS adds the background, flexbox layout, hover effects, and gradient text â€” giving it a modern, interactive look.

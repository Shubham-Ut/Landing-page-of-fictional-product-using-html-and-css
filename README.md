# Landing-page-of-fictional-product-using-html-and-css
This is a landing page for a bicycle product, designed using only HTML and CSS.
When the page loads, you see a bold background image of an electric bike. At the top, there’s a neat navigation bar with the brand name, dropdown options, links like Connect and Leasing, and action buttons like “Order Now” and a cart icon. In the center, glowing text displays a tagline: Classic – Industry with wheels, giving a premium feel.
The HTML builds the basic structure. It includes a header section with brand and links using <div>, <ul>, <li>, <a>, and <select> elements. Below that, there’s a main section for the tagline using <p> and <h2>.
The CSS handles all the styling. It adds a background image, uses Flexbox for layout, and includes hover effects like color change and scaling. Gradient text effects and smooth transitions make the page look dynamic and modern.
